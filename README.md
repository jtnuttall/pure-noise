# pure-noise

Performant, modern noise generation for Haskell with a minimal dependency footprint.

This library is intended to maintain feature parity with FastNoiseLite.

## Performance notes

- This library benefits considerably from compilation with the LLVM backend (`-fllvm`). Benchmarks suggest a ~50-80% difference depending on the kind of noise.

## Benchmarks

### Results

Measured by values / second generated by the noise functions. These results come from a benchmark with `-fllvm` enabled.

All results are for `Float`s.

There's inevitably some noise in the measurements because all of the results are forced into an unboxed vector.

#### 2D
