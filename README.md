# pure-noise

Performant, modern noise generation for Haskell with a minimal dependency footprint.

Built on a unified `Noise p v` type that enables type-safe, composable noise functions.
The library uses only `base` and `primitive` as dependencies, achieving 84-95% of C++
FastNoiseLite performance through aggressive optimization and LLVM compilation.

The algorithms used in this library are ported from
[FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite). The library structure
has been retuned to fit better with Haskell semantics.

The public interface for this library is unlikely to change much, although the
implementations (`noiseBaseN` functions and anything in `Numeric.Noise.Internal`)
are subject to change and may change between minor versions.

## Usage

The library provides composable noise functions built on a unified `Noise` type.
`Noise2` and `Noise3` are convenient type aliases for 2D and 3D noise. Noise
functions can be composed using `Num`, `Fractional`, or `Applicative` methods
with minimal performance cost.

Noise values are generally clamped to `[-1, 1]`, although some noise functions
may occasionally produce values slightly outside this range.

### Basic Example

```haskell
import Numeric.Noise qualified as Noise

-- Compose multiple noise sources
myNoise2 :: (RealFrac a) => Noise.Seed -> a -> a -> a
myNoise2 =
  let fractalConfig = Noise.defaultFractalConfig
      combined = (Noise.perlin2 + Noise.superSimplex2) / 2
  in Noise.noise2At $ Noise.fractal2 fractalConfig combined
```

### Advanced Features

The library's unified `Noise p v` type enables powerful composition patterns:

**1D Noise via Slicing:**

Generate 1D noise by slicing higher-dimensional noise at a fixed coordinate:

```haskell
-- Create 1D noise by fixing one dimension
noise1d :: Noise.Noise1 Float
noise1d = Noise.sliceY2 0.0 Noise.perlin2

-- Evaluate at a point
value = Noise.noise1At noise1d seed 5.0
```

**Coordinate Transformation:**

Scale, rotate, or warp the coordinate space:

```haskell
-- Double the frequency
scaled = Noise.warp (\(x, y) -> (x * 2, y * 2)) Noise.perlin2

-- Rotate 45 degrees
rotated = Noise.warp (\(x, y) ->
  let a = pi / 4
  in (x * cos a - y * sin a, x * sin a + y * cos a)) Noise.perlin2
```

**Layering Independent Noise:**

Use `reseed` or `next2`/`next3` to create independent layers:

```haskell
layered = (Noise.perlin2 + Noise.next2 Noise.perlin2) / 2
```

More examples can be found in `bench` and `demo`.

## Performance Improvements

This release brings significant performance enhancements across nearly all noise types:

- **+32% average improvement** across all benchmarks
- **Cellular noise: +61-70%** through specialized REWRITE RULES
- **3D ValueCubic: +45-80%** for fractal variants
- **Ping-pong fractals: +110-148%** through branchless optimization
- **Perlin/Value: +10-43%** through optimized interpolation

Note: SuperSimplex benchmarks reflect a methodology improvement (independent X/Y sampling
rather than diagonal-only sampling), resulting in more realistic performance measurements.

## Parallel noise generation

For large-scale noise generation, this library integrates well with
[massiv](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/massiv) for parallel computation.
Parallel performance can reach 10-15Ã— single-threaded performance by leveraging
multiple cores. For example, 2D Perlin noise generation achieves ~1.73 billion
values/sec on an i9-13900K. This is the recommended approach for generating
large noise textures or datasets.

## Performance notes

- This library benefits considerably from compilation with the LLVM backend
  (`-fllvm`). Benchmarks suggest a ~50-80% difference depending on the kind of noise.
- In single-threaded scenarios with LLVM enabled, this library achieves 84-95%
  of C++ FastNoiseLite performance, with simpler noise algorithms (Perlin,
  OpenSimplex2, SuperSimplex, Cellular) reaching 86-95% of C++ speed.

## Benchmarks

### Results

Measured by values / second generated by the noise functions. These results come
from a benchmark with `-fllvm` enabled.

There's inevitably some noise in the measurements because all of the results are
forced into an unboxed vector.
